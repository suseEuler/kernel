Subject: [PATCH] mm/page_owner: record the timestamp of all pages during free
Git-commit: 866b485262173a2b873386162b2ddcfbcb542b4a
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: bsn#12


Collect the time when each allocation is freed, to help with memory
analysis with kdump/ramdump.  Add the timestamp also in the page_owner
debugfs file and print it in dump_page().

Having another timestamp when we free the page helps for debugging page
migration issues.  For example both alloc and free timestamps being the
same can gave hints that there is an issue with migrating memory, as
opposed to a page just being dropped during migration.
