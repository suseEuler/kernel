Subject: [PATCH] crypto: hisilicon/sec - fix the process of disabling sva
 prefetching
Git-commit: 66192b2e3fd8ab97ed518d6c0240e26655a20b4b
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: bsn#12

The open interface of the sva prefetching function is distinguish the chip
version. But the close interface of the sva prefetching function doesn't
distinguish the chip version. As a result, the sva prefetching close
operation is also performed on Kunpeng920, those registers are important
on Kunpeng920, which eventually leads to abnormal hardware problems. So
need to fix it immediately.
