Subject: [PATCH] kfence: zero guard page after out-of-bounds access
Git-commit: 94868a1e127bbe0e03a4467f27196cd668cbc344
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: bsn#12


After an out-of-bounds accesses, zero the guard page before re-protecting
in kfence_guarded_free().  On one hand this helps make the failure mode of
subsequent out-of-bounds accesses more deterministic, but could also
prevent certain information leaks.
