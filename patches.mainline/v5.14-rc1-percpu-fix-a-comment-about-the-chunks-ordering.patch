Subject: [PATCH] percpu: fix a comment about the chunks ordering
Git-commit: ac9380f6b8a6a908a9df023bf8a2bcdaf9d2d6cb
Patch-mainline: v5.14-rc1
References: bsn#12


Since the commit 3e54097beb22 ("percpu: manage chunks based on
contig_bits instead of free_bytes") chunks are sorted based on the
size of the biggest continuous free area instead of the total number
of free bytes. Update the corresponding comment to reflect this.
