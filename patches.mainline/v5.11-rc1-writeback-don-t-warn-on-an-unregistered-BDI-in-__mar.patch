Subject: [PATCH] writeback: don't warn on an unregistered BDI in
 __mark_inode_dirty
Git-commit: f7387170339afb473a0d95b7732f904346f9795e
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: bsn#12

BDIs get unregistered during device removal, and this WARN can be
trivially triggered by hot-removing a NVMe device while running fsx
It is otherwise harmless as we still hold a BDI reference, and the
writeback has been shut down already.
