Subject: [PATCH] net: make sure devices go through netdev_wait_all_refs
Git-commit: 766b0515d5bec4b780750773ed3009b148df8c0a
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc4
References: bsn#12


If register_netdevice() fails at the very last stage - the
notifier call - some subsystems may have already seen it and
grabbed a reference. struct net_device can't be freed right
away without calling netdev_wait_all_refs().

Now that we have a clean interface in form of dev->needs_free_netdev
and lenient free_netdev() we can undo what commit 93ee31f14f6f ("[NET]:
Fix free_netdev on register_netdev failure.") has done and complete
the unregistration path by bringing the net_set_todo() call back.

After registration fails user is still expected to explicitly
free the net_device, so make sure ->needs_free_netdev is cleared,
otherwise rolling back the registration will cause the old double
free for callers who release rtnl_lock before the free.

This also solves the problem of priv_destructor not being called
on notifier error.

net_set_todo() will be moved back into unregister_netdevice_queue()
in a follow up.
