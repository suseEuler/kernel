 DAMON provides below three interfaces for different users.
 
 - *DAMON user space tool.*
-  This is for privileged people such as system administrators who want a
-  just-working human-friendly interface.  Using this, users can use the DAMON’s
-  major features in a human-friendly way.  It may not be highly tuned for
-  special cases, though.  It supports both virtual and physical address spaces
-  monitoring.

 - *debugfs interface.*
-  This is for privileged user space programmers who want more optimized use of
-  DAMON.  Using this, users can use DAMON’s major features by reading
-  from and writing to special debugfs files.  Therefore, you can write and use
-  your personalized DAMON debugfs wrapper programs that reads/writes the
-  debugfs files instead of you.  The DAMON user space tool is also a reference
-  implementation of such programs.  It supports both virtual and physical
-  address spaces monitoring.
