Subject: [PATCH] xfs: flush speculative space allocations when we run out of
 space
Git-commit: a1a7d05a05765eec042942a5c360e909c0dd0131
Patch-mainline: v5.12-rc2
References: bsn#12
Modified-by-SEL: No


If a fs modification (creation, file write, reflink, etc.) is unable to
reserve enough space to handle the modification, try clearing whatever
space the filesystem might have been hanging onto in the hopes of
speeding up the filesystem.  The flushing behavior will become
particularly important when we add deferred inode inactivation because
that will increase the amount of space that isn't actively tied to user
data.
