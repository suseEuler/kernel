+Schemes
+-------
+
+For usual DAMON-based data access aware memory management optimizations, users
+would simply want the system to apply a memory management action to a memory
+region of a specific size having a specific access frequency for a specific
+time.  DAMON receives such formalized operation schemes from the user and
+applies those to the target processes.  It also counts the total number and
+size of regions that each scheme is applied.  This statistics can be used for
+online analysis or tuning of the schemes.
+
+Users can get and set the schemes by reading from and writing to ``schemes``
+debugfs file.  Reading the file also shows the statistics of each scheme.  To
+the file, each of the schemes should be represented in each line in below form:
+
+    min-size max-size min-acc max-acc min-age max-age action
+
+Note that the ranges are closed interval.  Bytes for the size of regions
+(``min-size`` and ``max-size``), number of monitored accesses per aggregate
+interval for access frequency (``min-acc`` and ``max-acc``), number of
+aggregate intervals for the age of regions (``min-age`` and ``max-age``), and a
+predefined integer for memory management actions should be used.  The supported
+numbers and their meanings are as below.
+
+ - 0: Call ``madvise()`` for the region with ``MADV_WILLNEED``
+ - 1: Call ``madvise()`` for the region with ``MADV_COLD``
+ - 2: Call ``madvise()`` for the region with ``MADV_PAGEOUT``
+ - 3: Call ``madvise()`` for the region with ``MADV_HUGEPAGE``
+ - 4: Call ``madvise()`` for the region with ``MADV_NOHUGEPAGE``
+ - 5: Do nothing but count the statistics
+
+You can disable schemes by simply writing an empty string to the file.  For
+example, below commands applies a scheme saying "If a memory region of size in
+[4KiB, 8KiB] is showing accesses per aggregate interval in [0, 5] for aggregate
+interval in [10, 20], page out the region", check the entered scheme again, and
+finally remove the scheme. ::
+
+    # cd <debugfs>/damon
+    # echo "4096 8192    0 5    10 20    2" > schemes
+    # cat schemes
+    4096 8192 0 5 10 20 2 0 0
+    # echo > schemes
+
+The last two integers in the 4th line of above example is the total number and
+the total size of the regions that the scheme is applied.
