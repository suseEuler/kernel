Subject: [PATCH] mm/lru: revise the comments of lru_lock
Git-commit: 15b447361794271f4d03c04d82276a841fe06328
Patch-mainline: v5.11-rc1
References: bsn#12

Since we changed the pgdat->lru_lock to lruvec->lru_lock, it's time to fix
the incorrect comments in code.  Also fixed some zone->lru_lock comment
error from ancient time.  etc.

I struggled to understand the comment above move_pages_to_lru() (surely
it never calls page_referenced()), and eventually realized that most of
it had got separated from shrink_active_list(): move that comment back.

 ======
-        Each memcg has its own private LRU. Now, its handling is under global
-	VM's control (means that it's handled under global pgdat->lru_lock).
-	Almost all routines around memcg's LRU is called by global LRU's
-	list management functions under pgdat->lru_lock.
-
-	A special function is mem_cgroup_isolate_pages(). This scans
-	memcg's private LRU and call __isolate_lru_page() to extract a page
-	from LRU.
-
-	(By __isolate_lru_page(), the page is removed from both of global and
-	private LRU.)
-
+	Each memcg has its own vector of LRUs (inactive anon, active anon,
+	inactive file, active file, unevictable) of pages from each node,
