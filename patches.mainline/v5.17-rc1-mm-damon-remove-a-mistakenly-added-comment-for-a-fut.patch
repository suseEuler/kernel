Subject: [PATCH] mm/damon: remove a mistakenly added comment for a future
 feature
Git-commit: f4c6d22c6cf282ef7d24a724b9bd978ee2b74fc6
Patch-mainline: v5.17-rc1
References: bsn#12
Modified-by-SEL: No


Due to a mistake in patches reordering, a comment for a future feature
called 'arbitrary monitoring target support'[1], which is still under
development, has added.  Because it only introduces confusion and we
don't have a plan to post the patches soon, this commit removes the
mistakenly added part.
