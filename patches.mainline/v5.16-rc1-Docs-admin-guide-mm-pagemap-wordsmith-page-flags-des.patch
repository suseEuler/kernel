Subject: [PATCH] Docs/admin-guide/mm/pagemap: wordsmith page flags
 descriptions
Git-commit: 0d16cfd46b48689de6a5ca594bc1a68105f6658b
Patch-mainline: v5.16-rc1
References: bsn#1

Some descriptions of page flags in 'pagemap.rst' are written in
assumption of none-rst, which respects every new line, as below:

    7 - SLAB
       page is managed by the SLAB/SLOB/SLUB/SLQB kernel memory allocator
       When compound page is used, SLUB/SLQB will only set this flag on the head

Because rst ignores the new line between the first sentence and second
sentence, resulting html looks a little bit weird, as below.

    7 - SLAB
    page is managed by the SLAB/SLOB/SLUB/SLQB kernel memory allocator When
                                                                       ^
    compound page is used, SLUB/SLQB will only set this flag on the head
    page; SLOB will not flag it at all.

This change makes it more natural and consistent with other parts in the
rendered version.
