Subject: [PATCH] mm: remove nrexceptional from inode: remove BUG_ON
Git-commit: 786b31121a2ce4309a81a7f36d63f02ca588839e
Patch-mainline: v5.13-rc1
References: bsn#12


clear_inode()'s BUG_ON(!mapping_empty(&inode->i_data)) is unsafe: we
know of two ways in which nodes can and do (on rare occasions) get left
behind.  Until those are fixed, do not BUG_ON() nor even WARN_ON().

Yes, this will then leak those nodes (or the next user of the struct
inode may use them); but this has been happening for years, and the new
BUG_ON(!mapping_empty) was only guilty of revealing that.  A proper fix
will follow, but no hurry.
