bugzilla: 47256
CVE: NA

---------------------------

Our system encountered a use-after-free when re-register the same
kretprobe, it access the kretprobe_instance in rp->free_instances
which has been released already.

Prevent re-registration has been implemented for kprobe before, but
it's too late for kretprobe. We must check the re-registration before
re-initializing the kretprobe, otherwise it will destroy the data and
struct of the kretprobe registered, it can lead to use-after-free,
memory leak, system crash, and even other unexpected behaviors.

Use check_kprobe_rereg() to check re-registration, also give a warning
message.

v2: cherry pick and merge WARN_ON bugfix commit
6ca427f53643100fdb795bd88073fd7bba256702.
