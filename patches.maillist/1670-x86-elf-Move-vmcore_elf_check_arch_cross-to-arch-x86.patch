-------------------------------------------------

Move macro vmcore_elf_check_arch_cross from arch/x86/include/asm/kexec.h
to arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h to fix the following compiling warning:

In file included from arch/x86/kernel/setup.c:39:0:
./arch/x86/include/asm/kexec.h:77:0: warning: "vmcore_elf_check_arch_cross" redefined
 # define vmcore_elf_check_arch_cross(x) ((x)->e_machine == EM_X86_64)

In file included from arch/x86/kernel/setup.c:9:0:
./include/linux/crash_dump.h:39:0: note: this is the location of the previous definition
 #define vmcore_elf_check_arch_cross(x) 0

The root cause is that vmcore_elf_check_arch_cross under CONFIG_CRASH_CORE
depend on CONFIG_KEXEC_CORE. Commit 532b66d2279d ("x86: kdump: move
reserve_crashkernel[_low]() into crash_core.c") triggered the issue.

Suggested by Mike, simply move vmcore_elf_check_arch_cross from
arch/x86/include/asm/kexec.h to arch/x86/include/asm/elf.h to fix
the warning.
