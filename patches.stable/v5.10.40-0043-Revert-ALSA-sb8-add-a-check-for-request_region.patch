Subject: [PATCH] Revert "ALSA: sb8: add a check for request_region"
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.40

commit 94f88309f201821073f57ae6005caefa61bf7b7e upstream.

This reverts commit dcd0feac9bab901d5739de51b3f69840851f8919.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The original commit message for this change was incorrect as the code
path can never result in a NULL dereference, alluding to the fact that
whatever tool was used to "find this" is broken.  It's just an optional
resource reservation, so removing this check is fine.
