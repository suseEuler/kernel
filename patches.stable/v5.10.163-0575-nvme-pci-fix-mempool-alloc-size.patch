Subject: [PATCH] nvme-pci: fix mempool alloc size
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.163

[ Upstream commit c89a529e823d51dd23c7ec0c047c7a454a428541 ]

Convert the max size to bytes to match the units of the divisor that
calculates the worst-case number of PRP entries.

The result is used to determine how many PRP Lists are required. The
code was previously rounding this to 1 list, but we can require 2 in the
worst case. In that scenario, the driver would corrupt memory beyond the
size provided by the mempool.

While unlikely to occur (you'd need a 4MB in exactly 127 phys segments
on a queue that doesn't support SGLs), this memory corruption has been
observed by kfence.
