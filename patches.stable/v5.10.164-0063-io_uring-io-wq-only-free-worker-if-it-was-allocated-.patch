Subject: [PATCH] io_uring/io-wq: only free worker if it was allocated for
 creation
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.164

commit e6db6f9398dadcbc06318a133d4c44a2d3844e61 upstream.

We have two types of task_work based creation, one is using an existing
worker to setup a new one (eg when going to sleep and we have no free
workers), and the other is allocating a new worker. Only the latter
should be freed when we cancel task_work creation for a new worker.

Fixes: af82425c6a2d ("io_uring/io-wq: free worker if task_work creation is canceled")
