Subject: [PATCH] s390/dasd: fix hanging IO request during DASD driver unbind
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.24

commit 66f669a272898feb1c69b770e1504aa2ec7723d1 upstream.

Prevent that an IO request is build during device shutdown initiated by
a driver unbind. This request will never be able to be processed or
canceled and will hang forever. This will lead also to a hanging unbind.

Fix by checking not only if the device is in READY state but also check
that there is no device offline initiated before building a new IO request.
