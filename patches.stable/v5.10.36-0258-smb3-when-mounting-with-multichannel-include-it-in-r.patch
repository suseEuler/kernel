Subject: [PATCH] smb3: when mounting with multichannel include it in requested
 capabilities
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.36

commit 679971e7213174efb56abc8fab1299d0a88db0e8 upstream.

In the SMB3/SMB3.1.1 negotiate protocol request, we are supposed to
advertise CAP_MULTICHANNEL capability when establishing multiple
channels has been requested by the user doing the mount. See MS-SMB2
sections 2.2.3 and 3.2.5.2

Without setting it there is some risk that multichannel could fail
if the server interpreted the field strictly.
