Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Fix exclusive limit for IPA size
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.24

commit 262b003d059c6671601a19057e9fe1a5e7f23722 upstream.

When registering a memslot, we check the size and location of that
memslot against the IPA size to ensure that we can provide guest
access to the whole of the memory.

Unfortunately, this check rejects memslot that end-up at the exact
limit of the addressing capability for a given IPA size. For example,
it refuses the creation of a 2GB memslot at 0x8000000 with a 32bit
IPA space.

Fix it by relaxing the check to accept a memslot reaching the
limit of the IPA space.
