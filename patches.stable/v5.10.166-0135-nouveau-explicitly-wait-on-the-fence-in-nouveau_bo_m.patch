Subject: [PATCH] nouveau: explicitly wait on the fence in nouveau_bo_move_m2mf
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.166

commit 6b04ce966a738ecdd9294c9593e48513c0dc90aa upstream.

It is a bit unlcear to us why that's helping, but it does and unbreaks
suspend/resume on a lot of GPUs without any known drawbacks.
