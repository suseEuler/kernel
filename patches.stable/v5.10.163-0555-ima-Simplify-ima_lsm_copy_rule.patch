Subject: [PATCH] ima: Simplify ima_lsm_copy_rule
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.163

[ Upstream commit d57378d3aa4d864d9e590482602068af1b20c0c5 ]

Currently ima_lsm_copy_rule() set the arg_p field of the source rule to
NULL, so that the source rule could be freed afterward. It does not make
sense for this behavior to be inside a "copy" function. So move it
outside and let the caller handle this field.

ima_lsm_copy_rule() now produce a shallow copy of the original entry
including args_p field. Meaning only the lsm.rule and the rule itself
should be freed for the original rule. Thus, instead of calling
ima_lsm_free_rule() which frees lsm.rule as well as args_p field, free
the lsm.rule directly.
