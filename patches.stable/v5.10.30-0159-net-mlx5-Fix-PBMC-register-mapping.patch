Subject: [PATCH] net/mlx5: Fix PBMC register mapping
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.30

[ Upstream commit 534b1204ca4694db1093b15cf3e79a99fcb6a6da ]

Add reserved mapping to cover all the register in order to avoid setting
arbitrary values to newer FW which implements the reserved fields.
