Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: ls1028a: fix ENETC PTP clock input
References: bsn#19
Patch-mainline: v5.10.4

[ Upstream commit d0570a575aa83116bd0f6a99c4de548af773d950 ]

On the LS1028A the ENETC reference clock is connected to 4th HWA output,
see Figure 7 "Clock subsystem block diagram".

The PHC may run with a wrong frequency. ptp_qoriq_auto_config() will read
the clock speed of the clock given in the device tree. It is likely that,
on the reference board this wasn't noticed because both clocks have the
same frequency. But this must not be always the case. Fix it.
